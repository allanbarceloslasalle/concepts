SOLID is an acronym representing five principles of object-oriented programming and design. These principles aim to create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable code. Here's a breakdown of each principle:

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility or job.
   - **Purpose**: This principle helps in reducing the complexity of the class, making it easier to maintain and understand. If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one responsibility might impact others, leading to fragile code.
   - 
2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Purpose**: This principle encourages you to design your code in a way that allows new functionality to be added without altering existing code. It promotes the use of abstract classes or interfaces to achieve this extensibility.

3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - **Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - **Purpose**: This principle ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without causing errors or unexpected behavior. It helps in maintaining the integrity of the code when subclasses are used.

4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of one large, general-purpose interface, create smaller, more specific interfaces.
   - **Purpose**: This principle aims to reduce the impact of changes by ensuring that classes only need to implement methods that are relevant to them. It avoids the problem of a class being burdened with methods it doesn't need.

5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
   - **Purpose**: This principle promotes the decoupling of code, making it more flexible and easier to modify. It encourages the use of abstractions (like interfaces) rather than concrete implementations, allowing for easier changes and testing.

Applying these SOLID principles can lead to more robust and maintainable software, making it easier to manage and extend as the project evolves.
